# Netliclicker - a [Netlify Extension](https://sdk.netlify.com) game to play while deploying

## Make Your Own Game

Delete all the files from the `src/components` directory and start building your own game from scratch. The file you will name `Game.tsx` will be the main file for your game.

Before the launch of the game directory, you will need to add yourself to the feature flag to test games in the Netlify app. The feature flag is called `site_build_game_surface`.

**Remember to test in dark mode! And light mode!**

## Publish

Are you ready to deploy and publish your extension? Check out our documentation on [publishing your extension](https://developers.netlify.com/sdk/publish/).
